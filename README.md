This is a chimera of solutions scraped from

- `create-electron-vite` - vue flavored
- `create-vite` - svelte flavored
- `create-electron-app` - to integrate electron forge

which was then stripped down (possibly unwisely for say, windows users), and with my own hacks on top to get things working.

This only demonstrates proof of concept, please see the [license](./LICENSE) for more details (copied from `Speykious/cve-rs`).
